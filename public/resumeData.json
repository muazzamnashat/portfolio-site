    "bio": "During my grad school at Central Michigan University, I took some data mining classes, and I learned R and SAS programming for data science! Although I had some technical knowledge working as a data analyst, I did not know all the wonderful things coding can do for us. I realized that rather than building statistical models, I wanted to create products people can interact with every day. That is when I found out about Software Engineering! I want to bring ideas to reality, and what could be a better way than coding! I am excited to leverage my analytical and coding skills to build products that would provide value to companies and their customers! I am currently enjoying JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and React.",
